# drift

Drift is a migration library written in Clojure. Drift works much like Rails migrations where a directory in your
project contains all of the migration files. Drift will detect which migration files need to be run and run them as
appropriate.

## Usage

To use Drift you'll need to add drift to your Leiningen project. Simply add the following to your project.clj file:

[drift "1.1.0"]

To set your Drift migration directory, simply add a clojure file called "migrate_config.clj" to the directory
"src/config".

Your migrate_config.clj file should look something like:

 (ns config.migrate-config)

 (defn migrate-config []
   { :directory "/test/migrations"
     :current-version current-db-version-fn
     :update-version update-db-version-fn })

Current-db-version-fn and update-db-version-fn are both function which you must implement to let Drift read and set the
current db version.

Current-db-version-fn does not take any parameters, and returns the current version of the database. If no version has
been set, then current-db-version-fn must return 0.

Update-db-version-fn takes only a new-version parameter. After update-db-version-fn is run with a given new-version,
current-db-version-fn must return that version.

For example, here is an in memory db version (Note, you do not want to do this):

 (ns config.migrate-config)
 
 (def version (atom nil))
 
 (defn memory-current-db-version []
   (or @version 0)) 
 
 (defn memory-update-db-version [new-version]
   (swap! version #(identity %2) new-version)) 
 
 (defn migrate-config []
   { :directory "/test/migrations"
     :current-version memory-current-db-version
     :update-version memory-update-db-version })


Using a table named "schema_migrations" that has one version column with a single value holding the current database version:

(ns config.migrate-config
  (:require [clojure.contrib.sql :as sql])
  (:use warehouse.core))

(defn db-version []
  (sql/with-connection DB
    (sql/with-query-results res 
      ["select version from schema_migrations limit 1"]
      (:version (first res)))))

(defn update-db-version [version]
  (sql/with-connection DB
    (sql/insert-values :schema_migrations [:version] [version])))

## Using Leiningen

To migrate to the most recent version:

$ lein migrate
